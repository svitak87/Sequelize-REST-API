Overview:

This application is a REST API built using Sequelize, a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, to interact with a Postgres database. Below is a breakdown of each dependency:

Dependencies:
dotenv:
Dotenv is used for loading environment variables from a .env file into process.env. This is useful for securely storing and accessing sensitive information such as database credentials.

express:
Express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It is used to handle HTTP requests, define routes, and build the RESTful API endpoints.

morgan:
Morgan is an HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js. It simplifies the process of logging HTTP requests to the console, making it easier to debug and monitor the application.

pg:
pg is the PostgreSQL client for Node.js. It allows Node.js applications to interact with PostgreSQL databases by providing a native, low-level interface.

pg-hstore:
pg-hstore is a Node.js module for serializing and deserializing JSON data to and from hstore format. It is commonly used with Sequelize for storing JSON data in PostgreSQL.

sequelize:
Sequelize is a promise-based ORM for Node.js that supports multiple database dialects, including PostgreSQL. It simplifies database interactions by providing an intuitive API for defining models, querying data, and managing database relationships.

Getting Started:
To run this application:

Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if not already installed.
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run npm install to install the dependencies specified in the package.json file.
Set up a PostgreSQL database and configure the connection settings in a .env file.
Define Sequelize models to represent database tables and relationships.
Implement RESTful API routes using Express.js to handle CRUD operations.
Start the server using Node.js.
